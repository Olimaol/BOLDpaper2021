    extras.py:
        - functions which are used globally
    parameters.py:
        - parameters which are used globally
    model_neuronmodels.py:
        - defintion of RS and FS cortical neuron models
    model.py:
        - defintion of model (populations, projections)
    get_weightDist.py:
        - generate 1000 RS and FS cortical neurons
        - send 1 input spike
        - compares (Figures) distribution of caused PSPs in neurons with distribution of EPSPs from Song et al. (2005)
        - the weight distributions should adjusted manually to obtain a got fit (visual comparison) betwenn simulated and experimetnal distributions
    optimize_rates.py:
        - two modes, optimize and test
        - optimize mode:
            - optimizes parameters (input current distribution and number of afferent synapses of all neurons)
            - goodness of fit: simulated mean firing rate distribution vs. distribution similar to the firing rate distributions shown in Buzs√°ki & Mizuseki, (2014)
            - saves fitted parameters and loss
        - test mode:
            - load fitted params and prints loss
            - simulator optionally generates plots to also visually compare firing rate distributions
        - possible improvements:
            - connect with probabilities (part of the input pop) instead of fixed ammount (not more than 49 possible becasue of CorI size)
            - or larger pop sizes
            - calculate the loss over multiple initializations (average over randomness)
    run_parallel.sh:
        - shell script to run python files
    test.py:
        - python file for testing anything
